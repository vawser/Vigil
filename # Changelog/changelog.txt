   - Medium (4 types of plants) - 8 Manure
   - Large (6 types of plants) - 12 Manure
  - Once you have asked the Jar of Cultivation to cultivate the field, a timer will start. 
  - Once approximately 5 minutes has passed, the field will be ready. This time has to be continuous, map reloads will reset the timer.
  - Once the field is ready, an icon will appear in the player's top bar so the player is notified.
