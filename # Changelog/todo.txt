# Ideas
#-------------------------------------------------
# Concordats
- Implement covenants for each of the factions of Elden Ring
    - Operate like traditional covenants: 3 rewards at 10/20/30 turnins
    - Each require own token, token will be from certain (non-trival) enemies
    - Include TalkToPlayer stuff for this
    - Tokens can also deepen bond (like Cinders), providing covenant buff. This is removed if pledge is changed to another covenant.

# Shinobi's Challenge
- A platforming challenge that makes use of the multi-jump mechanics:

# Armor Ascension
- Add reinforcement-like system to armor via Tailoring menu

# Affinity Effects
- Add elemental buffs during certain attacks when infused with Fire/Magic/etc.
    For example: Fire Longsword would have a fire buff appear with the charged heavy attac
    Implementation:
        Notify HKS via notify SpEffect placed in TAE (0 duration)
        HKS will apply the affinty buff (i.e. Fire buff is applied if notify SpEffect is detected)
        
- Can also extend to bullets (i.e. fireball)

# Torrent Customisation
- Add the ability to improve Torrents attributes:
    - HP
    - Poise
    - Multi-Jump
    
    - Damaging Blast after Spiritspring jump (Stomp the Elden Beast)
    - Damaging Ram after Dashing
    - Emit Pools behind (Scarlet Rot, etc)

# Bosses
- Split Beast Clergyman and Maliketh into 2 fights

# Spells
- Expand Blood school
- Expand Death school

# Spirit Summons
- Add more types.
- Add method to allow multiple.

# Friendly Settlements
- Add in friendly settlements with NPCs and simple quests to give the player something to anchor their travel around:
    - Limgrave 
        - m60_46_39 - Grousewater Hamlet
        - Village being encroached upon by Caelid
        - NPCs are worried, but believe they can stop the spread of the rot
        - Player can under go a quest, killing a specific enemy after talking to the NPCs.
            - If killed, the NPCs will talk about how the spread has stopped after the player gets to the midgame.
            - Otherwise, the NPCs will all be dead if the player returns after reaching the midgame.

    - Weeping Penisula
        - m60_40_33 - Mousehole
        - NPC wives/husbands are found, worried about their other halves at sea.
        - A dragon has been spotted recently, and they are worried it will kill the sailors on their return.
        - Player can kill the dragon (spawn it in m60_41_33), if so then the other NPCs will appear in the village after Godrick is defeated
        - If Godrick is defeated and the dragon lives, then all the NPCs will be killed and the dragon will have moved to the village.
            - Add note that details how the player failed the NPCs from one of the NPCs to deepen the tragedy.
            
# Rot
- Have the rot spread out from Caelid as the player progresses through bosses.
    - Fodder enemies will be hidden and new Caelid enemies will be added.
    - Caelid assets could also be added.

# Soul
- Acting like the Skyrim stones, the sword shrine locations will allow the player to accept the soul from an 'entity'.
 - Acts like a 'archetype template', forcing the player into that specific niche.
 - Will be given via item when the player interacts with the shrine.
 - Use the cut content sleep enemy icons 
 
 IF player has no blessing
    REMOVE all blessings
    ADD shrine blessing
 ELSEIF player has shrine blessing
    REMOVE shrine blessing
 ELSEIF player has different blessing
    REMOVE all blessings
    ADD shrine blessing
