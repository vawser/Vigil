- Fix the HKS input bugs

#-------------------------------------------------
# Ideas
#-------------------------------------------------
# Enemy Density
- Mix up/add enemy encounters in the open world:
    - Limgrave
    - Liurnia
    - Caelid
    - Altus Plateau
    - Mt. Gelmir
    - Consecrated Snowfields
    - Mountaintops of the Giants

# Shinobi's Challenge
- A platforming challenge that makes use of the multi-jump mechanics:

# Friendly Settlements
- Add in friendly settlements with NPCs and simple quests to give the player something to anchor their travel around:
    - Limgrave 
        - m60_46_39 - Grousewater Hamlet
        - Village being encroached upon by Caelid
        - NPCs are worried, but believe they can stop the spread of the rot
        - Player can under go a quest, killing a specific enemy after talking to the NPCs.
            - If killed, the NPCs will talk about how the spread has stopped after the player gets to the midgame.
            - Otherwise, the NPCs will all be dead if the player returns after reaching the midgame.

    - Weeping Penisula
        - m60_40_33 - Mousehole
        - NPC wives/husbands are found, worried about their other halves at sea.
        - A dragon has been spotted recently, and they are worried it will kill the sailors on their return.
        - Player can kill the dragon (spawn it in m60_41_33), if so then the other NPCs will appear in the village after Godrick is defeated
        - If Godrick is defeated and the dragon lives, then all the NPCs will be killed and the dragon will have moved to the village.
            - Add note that details how the player failed the NPCs from one of the NPCs to deepen the tragedy.

# Spirit Summons
- Add more in (main blocker is icons)

# Castigations
- Implement curse-like system, without rune gain modifiers.
- Include magical restraints too.
- Mainly for self-challenges, although allows for easier integration of side challenges.

# Spell Ascension
- Add spell ascension system, allowing for more spell variants without massive overhead, plus magic progression.

# Concordats
- Implement covenants for each of the factions of Elden Ring
    - Operate like traditional covenants: 3 rewards at 10/20/30 turnins
    - Each require own token, token will be from certain (non-trival) enemies
    - Include TalkToPlayer stuff for this
    - Tokens can also deepen bond (like Cinders), providing covenant buff. This is removed if pledge is changed to another covenant.

# Torrent Customisation
- Add the ability to improve Torrents attributes:
    - HP
    - Poise
    - Jump

# Gladiator's Gauntlet
- Add 2 more swarm waves
- Implement boss version at Limgrave or Leyndell colosseum.

# Armor Ascension
- Add reinforcement-like system to armor via Tailoring menu

# Talisman Ascension
- Add affix-like system for accessories. Material would drop from the bosses and very rarely after any enemy kill.
    - +1 and +2 are available in NG0
    - +3 and +4 in NG+1
    - +5 in NG+2

# Affinity Effects
- Add elemental buffs during certain attacks when infused with Fire/Magic/etc.
    For example: Fire Longsword would have a fire buff appear with the charged heavy attac
    Implementation:
        Notify HKS via notify SpEffect placed in TAE (0 duration)
        HKS will apply the affinty buff (i.e. Fire buff is applied if notify SpEffect is detected)
        
- Can also extend to bullets (i.e. fireball)
