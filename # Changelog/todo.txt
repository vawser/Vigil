# Friendly Settlements
- Add in friendly settlements with NPCs and simple quests to give the player something to anchor their travel around:
    - Limgrave 
        - m60_46_39 - Grousewater Hamlet
        - Village being encroached upon by Caelid
        - NPCs are worried, but believe they can stop the spread of the rot
        - Player can under go a quest, killing a specific enemy after talking to the NPCs.
            - If killed, the NPCs will talk about how the spread has stopped after the player gets to the midgame.
            - Otherwise, the NPCs will all be dead if the player returns after reaching the midgame.

    - Weeping Penisula
        - m60_40_33 - Mousehole
        - NPC wives/husbands are found, worried about their other halves at sea.
        - A dragon has been spotted recently, and they are worried it will kill the sailors on their return.
        - Player can kill the dragon (spawn it in m60_41_33), if so then the other NPCs will appear in the village after Godrick is defeated
        - If Godrick is defeated and the dragon lives, then all the NPCs will be killed and the dragon will have moved to the village.
            - Add note that details how the player failed the NPCs from one of the NPCs to deepen the tragedy.
            
# Rot
- Have the rot spread out from Caelid as the player progresses through bosses.
    - Fodder enemies will be hidden and new Caelid enemies will be added.
    - Caelid assets could also be added.

# Concordats
- Implement covenants for each of the factions of Elden Ring
    - Operate like traditional covenants: 3 rewards at 10/20/30 turnins
    - Each require own token, token will be from certain (non-trival) enemies
    - Include TalkToPlayer stuff for this
    - Tokens can also deepen bond (like Cinders), providing covenant buff. This is removed if pledge is changed to another covenant.

# Shinobi's Challenge
- A platforming challenge that makes use of the multi-jump mechanics:

# Armor Ascension
- Add reinforcement-like system to armor via Tailoring menu

# Affinity Effects
- Add elemental buffs during certain attacks when infused with Fire/Magic/etc.
    For example: Fire Longsword would have a fire buff appear with the charged heavy attac
    Implementation:
        Notify HKS via notify SpEffect placed in TAE (0 duration)
        HKS will apply the affinty buff (i.e. Fire buff is applied if notify SpEffect is detected)
        
- Can also extend to bullets (i.e. fireball)

# Bosses
- Split Beast Clergyman and Maliketh so once Beast Clergyman has been defeated once, the player can skip straight to Maliketh.

# Content
- Expand Blood school
- Expand Death school
- Add Vow of Silence (Ofnir spell?) - Quietus
- Add Poison Bolt (Servant of Rot spell)
- Add new physicks
- Add new Spirit Summons.

# Sigils
- Acting like the Skyrim stones, the sword shrine locations will allow the player to accept the soul from an 'entity'.
 - Acts like a 'archetype template', forcing the player into that specific niche.
 - Will be given via item when the player interacts with the shrine.
 - Use the cut content sleep enemy icons
