- Added the following affinities:
    - Soporific: adds Sleep aux
    - Frenzied: adds Madness aux
    - Blighted: adds Blight aux

- Removed the affinity icons. 
 - This is due to the limitations of graphical modding which mean new affinities can't have icons. 
 - Removing them makes the menu look consistent and allows for more flexibility with a minor visual sacrifice.
