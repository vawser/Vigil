    - Here: you will remain at the chapel and proceed through the tutorial.
    - Roundtable Hold: you will be teleported to Roundtable Hold 

- There is 1 journey modifier:
    - Immediate Torrent: you will receive Torrent immediately.

#-------------------------------------------------
# Player
#-------------------------------------------------
- Made the Multi-Jump easier to execute by expanding the window in which you can jump whilst in midair.
- Multi-Jump now works simply by holding the jump button, instead of requiring L1.
- Multi-Jump no longer has a jump limit, but drains FP with each jump instead. Lacking FP will cause you to fall.
- Multi-Jump now works with all weapons.

- FP now regenerates in a stepped fashion:
    - Current FP below 100: 3 per second
    - Current FP between 100 and 250: 2 per second
    - Current FP above 250: 1 per second.
- Removed the +1% FP aspect of the regen.
