# Friendly Settlements
- Add in friendly settlements with NPCs and simple quests to give the player something to anchor their travel around:
    - Limgrave 
        - m60_46_39 - Grousewater Hamlet
        - Village being encroached upon by Caelid
        - NPCs are worried, but believe they can stop the spread of the rot
        - Player can under go a quest, killing a specific enemy after talking to the NPCs.
            - If killed, the NPCs will talk about how the spread has stopped after the player gets to the midgame.
            - Otherwise, the NPCs will all be dead if the player returns after reaching the midgame.

    - Weeping Penisula
        - m60_40_33 - Mousehole
        - NPC wives/husbands are found, worried about their other halves at sea.
        - A dragon has been spotted recently, and they are worried it will kill the sailors on their return.
        - Player can kill the dragon (spawn it in m60_41_33), if so then the other NPCs will appear in the village after Godrick is defeated
        - If Godrick is defeated and the dragon lives, then all the NPCs will be killed and the dragon will have moved to the village.
            - Add note that details how the player failed the NPCs from one of the NPCs to deepen the tragedy.
            
# Rot
- Have the rot spread out from Caelid as the player progresses through bosses.
    - Fodder enemies will be hidden and new Caelid enemies will be added.
    - Caelid assets could also be added.


# Shinobi's Challenge
- A platforming challenge that makes use of the multi-jump mechanics:

# Armor Ascension
- Add reinforcement-like system to armor via Tailoring menu

# Affinity Effects
- Add elemental buffs during certain attacks when infused with Fire/Magic/etc.
    For example: Fire Longsword would have a fire buff appear with the charged heavy attac
    Implementation:
        Notify HKS via notify SpEffect placed in TAE (0 duration)
        HKS will apply the affinty buff (i.e. Fire buff is applied if notify SpEffect is detected)
        
- Can also extend to bullets (i.e. fireball)

# Bosses
- Split Beast Clergyman and Maliketh so once Beast Clergyman has been defeated once, the player can skip straight to Maliketh.

# Content
- Add new physicks
- Add new Spirit Summons.

# Items
Add raisin that allows Torrent to 'charge' enemies

# Spell Schools to expand:
 - Bestial (+2)
 - Blood (+3)
 - Dragon Cult - Frozen Lightning (+2)
 - Aspects of the Crucible (+2)
 - Frenzied Flame (+2)
 - Black Flame (+3)
 - Servants of Rot (+3)
 - Claymen (+3)
 - Gravity (+3)
 - Magma (+2)

# Bugs to Fix
Fix Morgott not respawning correctly via Boss Revival

# Concordats
- Act like a class/covenant choice, where you pledge to a covenant and get their 'covenant' key item. 
 - This item will provide benefits that suit specific class archetypes.
 - Turns ins (Bloodsoaked Runes, or specific) will empower the pledge, allowing a player to commit hard into the class archetype.
 - Switching pledge will remove bonuses (but progress will be retained.)
 - Minor cost to pledge to discourage constant switching

- Simple quests given by the leader, similar to the Volcano Manor questline.
 - Reward specific items, like traditional Covenant rewards from DS1/DS3.
 
# Servants of the Grafted
- Found in Stormveil Castle.

- Benefits:
 - Enemy kills will empower physical damage by 1%. Only 1 kill is counted per second.
  - Each stack lasts 300 seconds.
  - Can stack upto 25 times. This is called 'Fully Grafted'.

- Drawbacks:
 - Each stack will reduce physical absorption by 1%.
 - Every time the player becomes fully grafted, they will be made slightly taller. This can stack up to 5 times. This can not be removed (other than visiting a secret location).
