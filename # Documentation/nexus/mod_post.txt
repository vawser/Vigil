# Overview
Vigil aims to provide an enhanced experience through Elden Ring for experienced players. Here is an overview of the changes:
- Gladiator's Gauntlet: a PVE survival-based mini-game with configurable options, allowing it to adapted to fit every stage of progression.
- Boss Rebirth: the ability to resurrect previously defeated bosses.
- Time Shift: the ability to set the current in-game time to a specific period.
- Weather Shift: the ability to set the current in-game weather to a specific type.
- Quickstart: the ability to immediately go to Roundtable Hold from the starting chapel.
- Statue of Draconic Communion: the ability to build a custom loadout instead of being restricted to a set class.

- Several tweaks to mechanics to better fit a replayable vision of Elden Ring:
 - Reinforcement materials have been simplified down to 4 tiers (like in DS1).
 - All affinities are available as soon as you pick up the Whetstone Knife.
 - Ashes of War are more flexible and can be used more widely.
 - You move faster, roll further and rally back HP innately.
 - The opportunity to gain the ability to jump in midair.
 
- Many new items to discover, such as:
  - Fractured Blade
  - Aberrant Eye
  - Gladiatorial Mark
  
- New enemy placements throughout the world of Elden Ring, mainly in the open world.
- Many other small tweaks and changes, such as adding the ability to hide your helm at the Clouded Mirror Stand.
